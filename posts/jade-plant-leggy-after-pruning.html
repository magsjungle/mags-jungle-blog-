    You pruned your jade. You were proud of yourself. And then... it just kept stretching. Long, spindly stems, weak growth, nothing like the compact little tree you were going for. The problem isn't your pruning technique — it's that pruning alone can't fix legginess.

    <h2>What Does "Leggy" Actually Mean?</h2>
    <p>
      A leggy jade plant has long, stretched stems with leaves spaced far apart — instead of that dense, compact, tree-like shape everyone is going for. It looks weak because it is weak. The plant is reaching for light it isn't getting, stretching itself out trying to find more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people see this and immediately reach for the pruning shears. Which is a great instinct — but only half the fix.
    </p>

    <h2>Pruning and Light Do Different Jobs</h2>
    <p>
      This is the thing most people miss, and once you get it, everything clicks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pruning tells your jade <em>where</em> to grow.</strong> When you cut a stem, the plant responds by branching out at that point — it creates new growth, new arms, more fullness. Pruning is about shape and structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Light controls how <em>tight</em> that growth stays.</strong> Strong light = compact, close nodes, dense leaves. Weak light = stretched, spaced-out, leggy growth — no matter how recently you pruned.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So if you prune without fixing the light, you'll get more branches — they'll just stretch right back out. You've created more of the problem, not less.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Actually Fix It</h2>

    <h3>Step 1 — Prune for shape</h3>
    <p>
      Cut back the leggy stems to just above a leaf node (the spot where a leaf meets the stem). This is where new branches will emerge. Don't be afraid to cut hard — jade plants are tough and bounce back well. Remove any stems that are crossing each other or growing in a direction you don't want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Use clean, sharp scissors or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNRJW3WM?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">pruning shears</a>. A clean cut heals faster and reduces the risk of rot on the cut end. Wipe the blade with rubbing alcohol between cuts if you're moving between plants.
    </p>

    <p class="image-caption">Cut just above a leaf node — that's where new branches will form</p> -->

    <h3>Step 2 — Fix the light immediately</h3>
    <p>
      This is the step people skip, and it's the reason their jade goes leggy again within weeks of pruning. Jade plants need <strong>bright light</strong> — more than most people give them indoors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Best case:</strong> A south or west-facing window with several hours of direct sun per day</li>
      <li><strong>No bright window?</strong> A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2BJPFZY?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">grow light</a> positioned 12–18 inches from the plant running 12–14 hours a day will do the job</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you're not sure whether your light is strong enough — it probably isn't. Jade plants in good light look noticeably different: leaves are plump, stems are thick, and new growth comes in tight and compact.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3 — Feed it after pruning</h3>
    <p>
      Pruning puts the plant into growth mode. Give it something to work with. I add <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4DP3GQ?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Purived Houseplant Food</a> to my watering when I do a big prune — it supports the new branching growth coming in without overfeeding. Don't fertilize in winter when jade is resting, but in the growing season (spring through summer) it helps a lot.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4 — Make sure the soil drains fast</h3>
    <p>
      Jade plants store water in their leaves and stems — they do not want to sit in wet soil. If your soil is holding moisture too long after watering, it can cause root stress that shows up as weak, leggy growth even when light is fine. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0799NMGPC?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Miracle-Gro Cactus & Succulent Mix</a> as a base and it drains beautifully.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Expect After You Fix Both</h2>
    <p>
      Within a few weeks of pruning + fixing the light, you should see new buds appearing at your cut points. Give it time — jade plants grow slowly, especially indoors. But the new growth that comes in will be compact and dense, not stretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If new growth is still stretching</strong> after you've made changes, the light still isn't strong enough. Move it closer to the window or lower your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2BJPFZY?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">grow light</a>.
    </p>

        <h4>Plant Grow Light</h4>
        <p>If your windows aren't cutting it, this is what I use. Position it close and run it 12–14 hours a day for compact growth.</p>

        <h4>Pruning Shears</h4>
        <p>Clean cuts matter. Sharp shears make a cleaner cut than scissors, which means faster healing and less rot on the cut end.</p>

        <p>Fast-draining soil is non-negotiable for jade. This is the base I use — it doesn't hold water long enough to cause root stress.</p>

    <h2>Quick Recap</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Leggy = a light problem</strong>, not just a pruning problem</li>
      <li><strong>Prune for shape</strong> — cut above a leaf node to trigger branching</li>
      <li><strong>Fix the light immediately</strong> — bright window or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2BJPFZY?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">grow light</a> running 12–14 hrs/day</li>
      <li><strong>Feed it</strong> — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4DP3GQ?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Purived Houseplant Food</a> after a big prune supports new growth</li>
      <li><strong>Check your soil</strong> — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0799NMGPC?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">fast-draining succulent mix</a> prevents root stress that can cause weak growth</li>
      <li><strong>New growth still stretching?</strong> The light still isn't strong enough — move it closer</li>
    </ol>
