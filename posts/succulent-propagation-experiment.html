    Same window. Same light. Same setup. Same start date. The only difference was moisture — and the results after five weeks were night and day. Here's exactly what happened.

    <h2>The Experiment 🧪</h2>
    <p>
      On December 28th, I threaded two different sedum leaves and hung them by the same window. Same spot, same natural light, started on the same day. The only variable I changed was moisture.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Orange sedum:</strong> lightly misted with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D22PPZCL?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">spray bottle</a> on a regular schedule</li>
      <li><strong>Green sedum:</strong> left completely dry — no spraying at all</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I checked back on February 4th — five weeks later. Here's what I found.
    </p>

    <!-- 📸 PHOTO SLOT: drop succulent-experiment.jpg in images/ and tell Claude -->
    <!-- <img src="../images/succulent-experiment.jpg" alt="Succulent propagation experiment — sprayed vs dry" class="post-image">
    <p class="image-caption">Left: sprayed regularly. Right: never sprayed. Five weeks of difference.</p> -->

    <h2>The Results After 5 Weeks</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>sprayed leaves</strong> were almost 100% successful. Strong roots forming, healthy little rosettes starting to emerge. Exactly what you want to see from propagation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>dry leaves</strong>? Very low success. Most of them just... sat there. No roots, no growth, no sign of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Same window. Same light. Same timing. The only difference was a little bit of water misted every few days.
    </p>

    <p class="image-caption">Sprayed (left) vs dry (right) — the difference is undeniable</p> -->

    <h2>The Big Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      Succulents have a reputation for loving dry conditions — and they do, once they're established. But during propagation, it's a completely different story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaf cuttings need a small amount of moisture to trigger root formation. They're not pulling water from soil yet — they have no roots. That tiny bit of humidity from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D22PPZCL?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">misting</a> is what tells them to start growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The rule:</strong> Don't soak them. Don't overwater them. But do <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D22PPZCL?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">mist lightly</a> every few days. That's it. That's the whole secret.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Thread Succulent Leaves for Propagation</h2>
    <p>
      Threading is one of my favorite propagation methods because it keeps the leaves off the soil, allows airflow underneath, and makes it easy to mist without creating soggy conditions. Here's how:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gently twist and pull a healthy leaf from the stem — make sure you get a clean break with the base intact</li>
      <li>Thread a thin string or wire through a container placed near your window</li>
      <li>Lay the leaves on top of the string so they're suspended, tip pointing down slightly</li>
      <li>Place them near a bright window (indirect light is fine)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D22PPZCL?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Mist lightly</a> every 2–3 days — just enough to add a little humidity</li>
      <li>Wait. Roots appear first, then a tiny rosette. This takes 4–8 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

        <h4>Grow Light</h4>
        <p>If you don't have a bright window, a grow light gives propagations the light they need to root faster.</p>

    <h2>Quick Recap</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Thread your leaves</strong> — suspended off the soil, near a bright window</li>
      <li><strong>Mist lightly</strong> every 2–3 days — don't soak, just add humidity</li>
      <li><strong>Be patient</strong> — roots take 4–8 weeks to appear</li>
      <li><strong>Pot them up</strong> once roots are established, into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0799NMGPC?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">fast-draining succulent soil</a></li>
    </ol>
