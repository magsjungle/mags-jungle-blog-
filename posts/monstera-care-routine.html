    "I wouldn't have killed my first monstera if I knew this before." — That's how my TikTok starts, and I mean every word. Here's the full care routine I use on Samantha, my monstera, so you don't have to learn the hard way like I did.

    <h2>Meet Samantha 🌿</h2>

    <p class="image-caption">Say hi to Samantha 🌿</p> -->

    <p>
      Samantha is my monstera, and I love taking care of her. She's taught me more about plants than any book ever could. The secret I've learned? Monsteras don't need constant fussing — they need <em>the basics done really well</em>. Consistent light, proper watering, clean leaves, and a little fertilizer go a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's my full care routine, step by step.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1 — Check the Roots First</h2>
    <p>
      Before I do anything else, I always check the roots. This tells me everything — is she root-bound? Is there rot? Are the roots a healthy white color or are they brown and mushy? You can't take care of a plant properly if you don't know what's happening underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the roots are circling the pot, it's time to repot. If they look healthy and there's still room, she stays put and I move on to the next step.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2 — Water Properly</h2>
    <p>
      I water Samantha thoroughly — not just a splash on the surface. I soak the soil until water drains out the bottom, then I let her dry out before watering again. Monsteras don't like sitting in wet soil. Overwatering is the #1 reason people kill their monsteras (I know because that's how I killed my first one).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>My rule:</strong> Stick your finger 2 inches into the soil. If it's still damp, wait. If it's dry, water.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3 — Fertilize with Purify Great Growth</h2>
    <p>
      I've been using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4DP3GQ?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank"><strong>Purived Houseplant Food</strong></a> on all my plants, not just Samantha. It's become a staple in my plant care routine. I add it when I water, following the instructions on the bottle, and the difference in growth has been noticeable — bigger leaves, faster growth, and that gorgeous deep green color.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4 — Aerate the Roots with a Chopstick</h2>
    <p>
      This is the step most people skip — and it makes such a difference. When I do the full care routine, I gently aerate the soil using a chopstick. I poke it down through the soil a few times around the pot, being careful not to damage the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? It breaks up compacted soil so water and nutrients can actually reach the roots instead of just running down the sides. The fertilizer works so much better when the roots can absorb it properly.
    </p>

    <p class="image-caption">Always check the roots first — healthy roots = healthy plant</p> -->

    <h2>Step 5 — Clean the Leaves (My Homemade Spray)</h2>
    <p>
      Dusty leaves can't photosynthesize properly and they're more vulnerable to pests. I wipe both sides of every leaf — yes, both sides — using my <strong>homemade "sexy plant juice"</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X29CCYN?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Neem oil</a></li>
      <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
      <li>A few drops of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00028EYJ8?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">peppermint castile soap</a></li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Mix it in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D22PPZCL?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">spray bottle</a>, mist the leaf, and wipe with my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTXL2QMD?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">fuzzy gloves</a>. The neem oil keeps pests away, the alcohol helps it absorb, and the peppermint soap acts as an emulsifier (it helps everything blend together). Pests <em>hate</em> this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Turn off your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2BJPFZY?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">grow light</a> before applying neem oil. The combination of grow light heat + neem oil on leaves can burn them. I learned this the hard way.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 6 — Check for Aerial Roots</h2>
    <p>
      After cleaning, I look for aerial roots. Monsteras grow these little root nubs from their stems — it's totally normal and actually a sign of a happy, thriving plant! You can leave them alone, tuck them into the soil, or if you want to propagate, that's where you make your cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha had some new aerial roots growing in this video and I was so proud of her.
