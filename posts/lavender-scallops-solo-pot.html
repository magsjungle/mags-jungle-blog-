    <h2>The Problem With Lavender Scallops in Arrangements</h2>
    <p>
      Lavender Scallops (<em>Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi</em>) looks like a polite little succulent when you buy it. Silvery-green leaves with scalloped edges, compact shape, fits perfectly in a mixed arrangement. And then a few months later, your other succulents start looking sad and faded while this one is thriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what's happening: Lavender Scallops is a <strong>fast grower for a succulent</strong>. It doesn't just grow — it spreads outward and upward in a way that gradually shades out everything around it. The plants underneath stop getting the light they need, start stretching, and eventually just give up. If your arrangement looks uneven or your smaller succulents are sulking, this is almost always the culprit.
    </p>

    <p class="image-caption">See how it's taken over? The other plants don't stand a chance.</p> -->

    <h2>Moving It to a Solo Pot</h2>
    <p>
      The fix is simple: give it its own pot. Lavender Scallops is beautiful and worth growing — it just needs to stop bullying its roommates. Once it has space, it can spread freely, get the light it needs on all sides, and do the thing everyone actually buys it for: <strong>turn that gorgeous deep purple at the leaf edges</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That purple color is a stress response to bright sunlight. In a crowded arrangement where it's competing for light, or where its leaves are shading themselves, you won't see that color fully develop. Solo pot, bright sun, and it will reward you.
    </p>

    <h2>What Soil to Use</h2>
    <p>
      This is non-negotiable for Kalanchoe: <strong>chunky, fast-draining soil</strong>. A wet Kalanchoe is a rotting Kalanchoe. The roots cannot sit in moisture — even briefly — without starting to break down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0799NMGPC?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Miracle-Gro Cactus & Succulent Mix</a> as my base and then I amend it with extra <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LSBPRSX?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">perlite</a> to open it up further. The goal is a mix that drains almost immediately when you water — no lingering moisture around the roots.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rock Trick</h2>
    <p>
      After repotting, I add a layer of small rocks or gravel on top of the soil around the base of the plant. This keeps the stem and base dry even after watering — the water drains through the rocks before it can pool against the stem. It's a small detail that makes a real difference with rot-prone succulents like Kalanchoe.
    </p>

    <p class="image-caption">Rocks keep the base dry. Simple and effective.</p> -->

    <h2>Feeding Lavender Scallops</h2>
    <p>
      Once it's settled into its new pot, you can support the new growth with a light feed during the growing season (spring and summer). I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7T7VYMJ?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Purived Cactus & Succulent Food</a> — it's formulated specifically for succulents so you're not overfeeding with nitrogen like a regular houseplant fertilizer would. Don't fertilize in fall or winter when the plant is resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want a second option, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X3RBDJ8?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">Schultz Cactus Plus Liquid Plant Food</a> (2-7-7 formula) is another one I keep on hand — the low nitrogen, higher phosphorus ratio is ideal for succulents and encourages blooming.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Expect After the Move</h2>
    <p>
      Give it a week or two to settle without watering — repotting is stressful and the roots need time to adjust before you introduce moisture. After that, water deeply and then let the soil dry out completely before watering again. Lavender Scallops is drought-tolerant; underwatering is almost always safer than overwatering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few weeks in bright light, you should start to see the purple deepening at the leaf margins. That's the sign it's happy and getting what it needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And check on your old arrangement — with the space bully gone, your other succulents should start perking up and growing toward the light again.
    </p>

    <h2>Coming Up Next</h2>
    <p>
      Lavender Scallops is one of the easiest succulents to propagate from a single leaf. I'm doing a propagation video next — follow <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mags.jungle" target="_blank">@mags.jungle on TikTok</a> so you don't miss it.

    <h2>Quick Recap</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Lavender Scallops is a fast grower</strong> — it will shade out other succulents in a shared arrangement</li>
      <li><strong>Move it to a solo pot</strong> so it can spread freely and stop competing</li>
      <li><strong>Use chunky, fast-draining soil</strong> — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0799NMGPC?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">succulent mix</a> plus extra <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LSBPRSX?tag=maguimartinez-20" target="_blank">perlite</a></li>
      <li><strong>Add rocks on top</strong> to keep the base and stem dry after watering</li>
      <li><strong>Bright sun = purple edges</strong> — it can't reach its full color potential in a crowded pot</li>
      <li><strong>Wait a week before watering</strong> after repotting, then water deeply and let it dry out completely</li>
    </ol>
